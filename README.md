# hello-world
My name is Fred Alejandro.
I am a senior at Univeristy of Houston Majoring in Computer Information Systems.
At UH, I have learned about Programming, Web-Development, Database design and implementation, Hardware, Networks, Integrated Information Systems, Basic Security Concepts, and more.
As I wrap up my last year here, I know I will learn so much more and look forward to using github as I finish my undergraduate education and move forward in to my professional career.
